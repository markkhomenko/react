# React & Typescript Qualification

This course is completely free and hosted on github. Its main intention is to take an engineer with some experience in Javascript and turn them into a React/Typescript badass. The course contains 5 sections each focusing on a different area and technology. Once this course is complete you will have enough knowledge and context to pick up other technologies and grow your React toolbelt.

From section 2 you will take the app you worked on and evolve it one step at a time. The code folder will give you an example of the expected end result. 

Please post any issues you have with the example code, course format or typos ... typos are my thing ...
