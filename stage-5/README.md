# Stage 5 - Testing

Testing is super important inside a UI project as they can become very complex. To do this we will look at several things:
- AAA testing
- Heavy abstraction in the render of a react component
- Understanding pure functions and why they are important and how to test them

## Instructions
- Review the posts and media
- Abstract logic into pure functions and test them
- Create React app ships with Jest and typescript support built in so no config required!
- Generate snapshots and write tests for components and views. For example:
```
 src/
    components/
      atoms/
        Button/
          __snapshots__ <-- Generated folder for snapshots.
          Button.component.tsx. <-- component code here
          Button.styles.tsx. <-- component styles here
          Button.stories.tsx. <-- component storybook
          Button.spec.tsx. <-- component tests
        ...
      ...
    ...
```
If you get lost please see the code folder for a working example

## Outcomes
- Understand AAA
- Understand how to use snapshots\
- Understand how to write production code that's easily testable
