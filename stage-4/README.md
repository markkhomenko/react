# Stage 4 - Storybooks

The Storybooks system allows us to showcase UI components in isolation in a library. This provides many different benefits but the main ones are:

- Engineers can quickly and easily access documentation on components and see what's already available to them
- Stakeholders can see demos of components in isolation
- Components are built in isolation from the rest of the app ensuring a decoupled and independent final result.

## Instructions

- Follow the Storybooks + Typescript + React Guide
- Add stories to each component. For example:
```
 src/
    components/
      atoms/
        Button/
          Button.component.tsx. <-- component code here
          Button.styles.tsx. <-- component styles here
          Button.stories.tsx. <-- component storybook
        ...
      ...
    ...
```
